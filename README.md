## A tool for creating tangible 360° video artifacts
This is the code for a website that helps create designers (and everyone else) create `tangible 360° video artifacts`. In order to share and collaborate on 360° video projects, we need a way to create tangible artifacts that represent the 360° video experience.

## What is a tangible 360° video artifact?

The core of a tangible 360° video artifact is a physical object that represents a single frame from 360° video, in this case we have two types of tangible artifacts:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://360artifact.com/examples/flat.png" alt="A flat artifact" width="200"></td>
    <td>1. <a href="/flat">flat artifacts</a>: a 2D representation of a frame of 360° video, with a specific focus and a minimap for overview.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://360artifact.com/examples/isohedron.png" alt="A sphere-ish artifact" width="200"></td>
    <td>2. <a href="/sphereish">sphere-ish artifacts</a>: a 3D representation of a frame of 360° video using a cut and fold pattern of a sphere-ish object.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### I want to know more

I, [Wo Meijer](https://womeijer.com), wrote a paper where I gave Tangi and the artifacts that it makes to designers with 360° video experinece. They did cool things!

Read the pre-print: [Tangi: a Tool to Create Tangible Artifacts for Sharing Insights from 360](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10192)

Reading this before [TEI 2025](https://tei.acm.org/2025/)? I will be presenting this paper there

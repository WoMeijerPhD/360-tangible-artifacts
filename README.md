# Tangible 360° Video Artifact Toolkit

This is the code for a website that helps create designers (and everyone else) create `tangible 360° video artifacts`. In order to share and collaborate on 360° video projects, we need a way to create tangible artifacts that represent the 360° video experience.

## What is a tangible 360° video artifact?

The core of a tangible 360° video artifact is a physical object that represents a single frame from 360° video, in this case we have two types of tangible artifacts:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://360artifact.com/examples/flat.png" alt="A flat artifact" width="200"></td>
    <td>1. flat artifacts: a 2D representation of a frame of 360° video, with a specific focus and a minimap for overview.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://360artifact.com/examples/isohedron.png" alt="A sphere-ish artifact" width="200"></td>
    <td>2. sphere-ish artifacts: a 3D representation of a frame of 360° video using a cut and fold pattern of a sphere-ish object.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
